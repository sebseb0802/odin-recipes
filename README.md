# Odin Recipes

## Project overview

In this project, I was tasked with creating a very simple website that includes descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions (all provided by https://www.allrecipes.com/) on how to make 3 of my favourite recipes.

## Skills demonstrated

In building this very simple starter project I have been able to demonstrate the following skills:
* Knowledge and understanding of the basic HTML boilerplate code.
* Ability to create links between pages in my website.
* Ability to display images throughout the website, including providing alternative text for those who use screen readers.
* Ability to use both relative and absolute paths (to images etc).
* Knowledge of the different heading types and when to use them.
* Ability to use both unordered and ordered lists.
